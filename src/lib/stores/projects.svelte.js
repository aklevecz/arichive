		descriptionLong: [
			`The flowers show was held on June 15th 2024 as the first official show at yaytso gallery featuring Ariel Klevecz and Remi Frogo.`,
			`Hundreds of lillies were generated using Stable Diffusion XL. 21 of them were selected and then upscaled and outpainted to an aspect ratio to fit a poster.`,
			`Each lily was then run through similar prompts using deforum to create a trippy immersive animation.`,
			`Each flower was printed and wheat pasted onto a wooden canvas board to bring it into the real world and give it an organic feel.`,
			`You can see the animations overlayed on the physical flowers using the augmented reality app on 8thwall.`,
			`I also created a experimental version of the AR experience in VisionOS, which was by far the best experience, but still needs to be refined.`,
			`Technology used: Stable Diffusion, 8th Wall, Swift (ARKit, VisionOS), JavaScript, Cloudflare Workers`
