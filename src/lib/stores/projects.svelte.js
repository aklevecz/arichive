		descriptionLong: [
			`The flowers show was held on June 15th 2024 as the first official show at yaytso gallery featuring Ariel Klevecz and Remi Frogo.`,
			`Hundreds of lillies were generated using Stable Diffusion XL. 21 of them were selected and then upscaled and outpainted to an aspect ratio to fit a poster.`,
			`Each lily was then run through similar prompts using deforum to create a trippy immersive animation.`,
			`Each flower was printed and wheat pasted onto a wooden canvas board to bring it into the real world and give it an organic feel.`,
			`You can see the animations overlayed on the physical flowers using the augmented reality app on 8thwall.`,
			`I also created a experimental version of the AR experience in VisionOS, which was by far the best experience, but still needs to be refined.`,
			`Technology used: Stable Diffusion, 8th Wall, Swift (ARKit, VisionOS), JavaScript, Cloudflare Workers`

			`I had always wanted to explore offline mode for a site, so I built a service worker and utilized the indexed db to persist form data in the browser that functions without an internet connection and will even send any changes made once internet connection is restored`,
			`The form also saves remotely on submission and at a particular interval after each change where data is sent to a SQL database and the Monday CRM.`,
			`For posterity I implemented the concept of a Project so that each form exists in its own project and a user can create multiple projects and switch between them`,
			`The spinning album cover is rendered using Three.js and is interactive, allowing the user to upload an image or generate on using Flux in the dream section`
